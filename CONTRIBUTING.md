# Contributing to Data Structures and Algorithms - The Ultimate Guide

First off, thank you for considering contributing! This project thrives on community effort, and we appreciate every contribution, from fixing a typo to adding a new algorithm implementation.

## How Can I Contribute?

There are many ways to contribute:

*   **Reporting Bugs:** If you find a bug in the code or an error in the explanations, please open an issue.
*   **Suggesting Enhancements:** Have an idea to make this repository better? Open an issue to discuss it.
*   **Improving Documentation:** Clarify explanations, fix typos, or add examples.
*   **Adding New Content:**
    *   Implement a data structure or algorithm in a new language.
    *   Add a new data structure or algorithm not yet covered.
    *   Provide solutions to common problems related to a topic.
*   **Reviewing Pull Requests:** Help review contributions from others.

## Getting Started

1.  **Fork the Repository:** Click the "Fork" button at the top right of the main repository page.
2.  **Clone Your Fork:** `git clone https://github.com/harshpreet931/The-Ultimate-DSA-Guide.git`
3.  **Create a Branch:** `git checkout -b feature/your-amazing-feature` or `fix/bug-fix-description`
4.  **Make Your Changes:** Implement your feature or fix the bug.
5.  **Commit Your Changes:** `git commit -m "Add: Brief description of your contribution"` or `Fix: Description of bug fixed`. (See our [Commit Message Guidelines](#commit-message-guidelines)).
6.  **Push to Your Fork:** `git push origin feature/your-amazing-feature`
7.  **Open a Pull Request (PR):** Go to the original repository and click "New pull request". Compare your feature branch with the `main` branch of the original repository.

## Pull Request Guidelines

*   **Clear Title and Description:** Explain the purpose of your PR and the changes made. Link to any relevant issues.
*   **Keep it Focused:** Each PR should address a single issue or add a single, well-defined feature.
*   **Code Quality:**
    *   Ensure your code is well-commented, especially for complex logic.
    *   Follow the coding style of the project (if one is established for the language you're using).
    *   Test your code thoroughly.
*   **Documentation:** If you're adding new code, update or add relevant documentation (`README.md` within the topic folder).
*   **One PR per Feature/Fix:** Do not bundle multiple unrelated changes into one PR.

## Commit Message Guidelines

We follow a conventional commit format to keep the commit history clean and readable. Please use prefixes like:

*   `feat:` (new feature)
*   `fix:` (bug fix)
*   `docs:` (documentation changes)
*   `style:` (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.; no code logic change)
*   `refactor:` (refactoring production code)
*   `test:` (adding or refactoring tests; no production code change)
*   `chore:` (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

**Example:**
`feat: Add Dijkstra's algorithm implementation in Python`
`docs: Correct typo in Array README`

## Code of Conduct

By contributing, you agree to abide by our [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We are committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment.

## Setting up Your Local Environment

*   For most contributions (like adding Markdown explanations or simple code snippets), you might not need a complex setup.
*   If you are adding code that needs compilation or has dependencies, please include instructions on how to set up the environment in the relevant `README.md` or as part of your PR description.
