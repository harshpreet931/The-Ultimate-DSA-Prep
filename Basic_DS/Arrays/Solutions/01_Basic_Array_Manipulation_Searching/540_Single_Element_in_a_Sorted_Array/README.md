## Solution Skeleton (Python)

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def singleNonDuplicate(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # TODO: Implement solution
        pass

# Example Usage (optional, for testing):
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.singleNonDuplicate([1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8])) # Expected: 2
# print(sol.singleNonDuplicate([3,3,7,7,10,11,11])) # Expected: 10
```
