<!-- Placeholder for the full problem description from LeetCode.
     Copy the problem description here from the LeetCode page for easy reference.
     Example: You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]). Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water. Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

## Solution Skeleton (Python)

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        # TODO: Implement solution
        pass

# Example Usage (optional, for testing):
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.maxArea([1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7])) # Expected: 49
# print(sol.maxArea([1,1]))             # Expected: 1
```
