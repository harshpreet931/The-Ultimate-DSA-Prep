## Problem Description (from LeetCode)

<!-- Placeholder for the full problem description from LeetCode.
     Copy the problem description here from the LeetCode page for easy reference.
     Example: Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length. Return the indices of the two numbers, index1 and index2, added by one as an integer array [index1, index2] of length 2.

## Solution Skeleton (Python)

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, numbers: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        # TODO: Implement solution
        pass

# Example Usage (optional, for testing):
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.twoSum([2,7,11,15], 9))  # Expected: [1,2]
# print(sol.twoSum([2,3,4], 6))      # Expected: [1,3]
# print(sol.twoSum([-1,0], -1))     # Expected: [1,2]
```
