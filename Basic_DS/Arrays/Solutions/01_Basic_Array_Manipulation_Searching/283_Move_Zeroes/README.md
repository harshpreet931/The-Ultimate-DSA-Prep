     Example: Given an integer array nums, move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
-->


## Solution Skeleton (Python)

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def moveZeroes(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        # TODO: Implement solution
        pass

# Example Usage (optional, for testing):
# sol = Solution()
# arr1 = [0,1,0,3,12]
# sol.moveZeroes(arr1)
# print(arr1) # Expected: [1,3,12,0,0]

# arr2 = [0]
# sol.moveZeroes(arr2)
# print(arr2) # Expected: [0]
```
