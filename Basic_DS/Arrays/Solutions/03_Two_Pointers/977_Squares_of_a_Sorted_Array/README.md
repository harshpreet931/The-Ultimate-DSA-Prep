## Solution Skeleton (Python)

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def sortedSquares(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # TODO: Implement solution
        pass

# Example Usage (optional, for testing):
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.sortedSquares([-4,-1,0,3,10])) # Expected: [0,1,9,16,100]
# print(sol.sortedSquares([-7,-3,2,3,11])) # Expected: [4,9,9,49,121]
```
